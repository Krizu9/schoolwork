Course feedback

After this course, i have understanding of what mobile application develompent is, and knowledge of its tools and how to use them.

At the beginning of this course, the materials and the aid material at exercises helped alot to get going. Sometimes things did not work,
but I could get the help off internet rather easily, when i knew what i was looking for.

The materials are suitable for virtual studies, that being alot more doing this by myself, so of course they would suit for contact studying too.

The workload for the firstimer that had to learn to use tools and everything abit too much in my opinion, but of course if i did not need to learn
to use all these tools, things would have been more simple.

I would give this course a solid 4 out of 5.

Evalution is fine, to pass the course with grade 2 its decent work, but to reach 5 needs a lot of work to get. And that is fine in my opinion.

After Future Factory, this course too by far the most effort than other courses, maybe because this was learning from ground experience.
React native was decent to learn, syntax is pretty much Javascript. Few things differed alot, and made this course challenging.

Thank you for the course, and have a warm summer!
