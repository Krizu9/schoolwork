# Course Feedback and Self-Evaluation

## How do you feel about the content of the course?

This courses content gave me clear understanding what android application development is, what are the challenges and how kotlin works.

## How do you feel about the course website and materials in GitLab/LabraNet?

Course website and materials in gitlab is well built and easy to follow.

## Is the material suitable for virtual study? If not, what should be improved?

I did this whole course as virtual study, and if I managed, everyone will manage haha.

## How about the workload (low, ok, too much)?

Workload compared to other courses is a bit on the higher side, but nothing too much.

## How about the evaluation (exercises and research assignment)?

Evaluation is set so you really need to learn something to pass the course, and really dedicate to this course to get a grade 5.

## Give a rating number from 1-5 (5 == excellent) to this course overall

4

## Something else you want to say...

Something I would recommend is to add somekind of "Q n A" page to the course materials, where you could cather biggest stepping stones from the students and answer to them there, that would help the "online" students, when asking for a question is a little more effort than in class room.

## Self-Evaluation:

### How have you learned Android Application Development?

Mostly with provided materials, some chatgpt, and googling. And of course a lot of trial and error.

### Analyze your own self-evaluation:

If I could go back and prepare myself to this course, I would tell Myself, that don't be affraid to test and play with things You found on the internet while doing these course exercises.

Be more brave to edit code and take snippets of your code as snapshots.
