This report documents the resourcing, technology choices, work process, and key learnings from the project.

## Resourcing

### Use of Time

The project timeline was effectively managed, allowing for a structured development process. The breakdown of time allocation is as follows:

- **Planning and Design:** 20%
- **Coding and Implementation:** 60%
- **Testing and Debugging:** 15%
- **Documentation and Report Writing:** 5%

Efficient time management ensured timely completion and allowed for a comprehensive testing phase.

## Technology Choices

### Front-End Development

- **HTML5 and Bootstrap:** Chosen for their responsiveness and ease of use in creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Utilized for dynamic content loading and interaction, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Fonts

- **Barlow Font:** Employed for its readability and aesthetic appeal, contributing to the overall design of the website.

### Version Control

- **Gitlab's Pages Function:** Utilized for hosting the final web page, providing seamless deployment.

## General Thoughts about the Work Process

### Solo Development

The entire development process for the "Amazing Shop" website was undertaken individually. Working alone provided an opportunity to take full ownership of the project and make independent decisions throughout each phase. Despite the absence of a collaborative team environment, the solo development approach allowed for focused and self-directed work.

### Self-Reflection

Working independently presented both challenges and advantages. On the positive side, it enhanced self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and a comprehensive understanding of the project. However, the absence of collaborative discussions and diverse perspectives also meant relying solely on personal insights and experiences.

### Lessons Learned

This solo endeavor served as a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of self-motivation, discipline, and adaptability. It also provided insights into the challenges and rewards of working independently on a development project.

### Key Learnings

1. **Practical Application of Bootstrap:**
   - Implement responsive design principles using Bootstrap to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
   - Explore and utilize Bootstrap components for efficient and visually appealing webpage development.

2. **API Integration:**
   - Gain practical experience in integrating external APIs into the website, enabling real-time data retrieval and display.
   - Understand the challenges and solutions related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) when fetching data from external sources.

3. **Git Workflow:**
   - Acquire proficiency in version control and collaborative coding practices using Gitlab.

4. **Web-Visualization:**
   - Enhance skills in web-visualization techniques by dynamically presenting data fetched from external APIs.
   - Utilize JavaScript to create interactive and visually engaging elements for a more compelling user interface.

## Grade Proposal

### Self-Grade: 3

### Reasoning:

- **Functionality:** The website successfully fulfills its purpose, allowing users to browse products, view details, and experience a smooth modal interaction.
